# WeeklyChallenge11

## Description
- What was your motivation? As someone who tends to take lots of notes it is nice to have a place where I can store, change or deltete them at any point. 
- Why did you build this project? I built this project so anyone who wants to have digital notes can use them. It offers a simple yet effective layout for a user friendly experience. 
- What problem does it solve? It solves the problem of trying to remember everything. With this project you can write whatever it is you want to jot down so you can look back at it at any point
- What did you learn? While creating this application I was able to learn and get a better understanding of express and server side routing.
