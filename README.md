# Note Taker App

## Description
- What was your motivation? As someone who tends to take lots of notes it is nice to have a place where I can store, change or delete them at any point. 
- Why did you build this project? I built this project so anyone who wants to have digital notes can use them. It offers a simple yet effective layout for a user friendly experience. 
- What problem does it solve? It solves the problem of trying to remember everything. With this project you can write whatever it is you want to jot down so you can look back at it at any point.
- What did you learn? While creating this application I was able to learn and get a better understanding of express and server side routing.

## Installation
You can install this with git bash by typing in 'git clone Replace this with link' to wherever you want the repository to be installed on your computer.

## Usage
You can use this by getting the repository downloaded with the instructions above. You can then open it with Visual Studio Code. You want to start the server by right clicking on server.js, opening it in integrated terminal and typing in 'node server.js'. It will open the server and from there you want to type in your browser 'http://localhost:3001/'. It will show the website where you can click Get Started and manage your notes. When you are finished with the application just go back to Visual Code Studio to where the terminal you used before was and pressing 'CTRL C'. This will end the server.

## Known Issues
-Saving, adding notes and deleting notes aren't functional.
-Text boxes are weirdly placed.
